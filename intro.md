Being a beginner is a big deal, your entire career gets built on top of it, and I want nothing more than to have a lucrative career. I think that doing an internship in a place like Github will give me what I need to start with right foot, it's one of the first steps towards the lucrative career I want. That's why I'm willing(and able) to work as hard as I, do my best and take the most out of that experience.
